I had to make a Pecha Kucha format Lightening talk and as I normal wing everything I found making the slides kind of boring so to make things a bit more interesting I made this gitpages site. It is not bad for practising your talk. If you want to use it just fork the repository then

1. Go in to settings and set Github Pages source to "master branch"
1. Go back into settings Github Pages and copy the new link to the top of this README.md file
1. Remember to wait about 30 seconds for any changes to showup. (I check ctrl-shift-i and look for the source to show my changes)
1. Delete my image.png files and drag your own images to the github (commit the files)
1. Change the index.html file to show your new images in the correct order.
